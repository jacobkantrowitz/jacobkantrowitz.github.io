=========================

Over time this page will evolve into a homepage for my research projects. Right now I am working mainly on one project, in which I am using mRNA expression level microarray data from bronchoscopy samples to investigate the interaction between Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and lung cancer. Specifically we are looking for COPD specific processes that are involved in lung carcinogenesis. The code hosted here represents the first year of my PhD training and my initial attempts at learning R. I am hoping to further formalize the code and structure as I continue to learn.
